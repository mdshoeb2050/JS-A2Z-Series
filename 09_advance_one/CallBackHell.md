Callback hell, also known as "Pyramid of Doom," is a situation in JavaScript where multiple nested callback functions make the code difficult to read and maintain. It often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or reading from files, where one operation depends on the result of another. Here's an example of callback hell:

```javascript
getDataFromServer(function(result) {
  processResult(result, function(processed) {
    saveData(processed, function(saved) {
      // More nested callbacks...
    });
  });
});
```

Callback hell can make code hard to follow, debug, and reason about, leading to maintenance challenges. To avoid callback hell, you can use several approaches:

1. **Use Promises**: Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, allowing you to chain `.then()` methods, as I mentioned in a previous response. Promises make code more linear and readable.

   ```javascript
   getDataFromServer()
     .then(result => processResult(result))
     .then(processed => saveData(processed))
     .then(saved => {
       // Continue here
     })
     .catch(error => handleError(error));
   ```

2. **Use `async/await`**: `async/await` is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, making asynchronous code appear synchronous. It enhances code readability and maintainability.

   ```javascript
   async function processData() {
     try {
       const result = await getDataFromServer();
       const processed = await processResult(result);
       const saved = await saveData(processed);
       // Continue here
     } catch (error) {
       handleError(error);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Modularization and Named Functions**: Break down your code into small, modular, and named functions. This approach reduces nesting and makes the code easier to understand. You can then compose these functions to create complex flows.

   ```javascript
   function getDataAndProcess() {
     getDataFromServer((result) => {
       processAndSave(result);
     });
   }

   function processAndSave(result) {
     processResult(result, (processed) => {
       saveData(processed, (saved) => {
         // Continue here
       });
     });
   }
   ```

4. **Use Control Flow Libraries**: Libraries like `async.js` or modern JavaScript constructs like `Promise.all` and `for...of` loops can help manage asynchronous operations in a more structured way.

   ```javascript
   const tasks = [getDataFromServer, processResult, saveData];
   Promise.all(tasks.map(task => task())).then(results => {
     // Handle results here
   });
   ```****

The use of Promises and `async/await` is the most modern and recommended approach to avoid callback hell and create more readable and maintainable asynchronous code. It's also in line with the JavaScript language's evolution, as it provides native support for handling asynchronous operations in a more structured manner.
