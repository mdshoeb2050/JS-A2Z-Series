/**********************\
*  Avoid Global Variables
\**********************/ 


// Each JS file which is associated with html file creates a Global varible 

// if there are multiple varibles present in multiple JS file with the same name will be override with current value.

// To avoid confusion use Let or const instead of using 'var'

// if any varible with same name present in anywhere in multipple file then it will create confusion and value get override with current varible value .
