# Module -2 

### Fundamentals of JS
- VARIABLES, DATA TYPES
- Learning the basics of the language
- OPERATORS & CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
- Working with operators and conditional statements 


### Loops, Arrays, Function & Objects
- LOOPS
- Working with various loops
- FUNCTIONS EXPRESSIONS V/S FUNCTION DECLARATION 
- Difference between  function expression and declaration 
- ARRAYS AND ITS USAGE AND INTRO TO OBJECTS
- What are arrays and using array functions like splice, slice, etc.
- Introduction to objects in JS


### Detailed topics what i have studied

- Function 
- Variable length Arguments 
<p>
less argument - NaN
More arguments - print result & Ignore 
</p>
- Function Hoisting  (move fun declaration on the top of program)
- Function and Scope ( A particula are where it has full access over its elements )
- Function within Function ( Recursion ,Nested fun)
- Function Expression ( storing fun res into a variable)
- Function Declaration vs Exprerssions ( fun Exp doesn't support Hoisting concept & widely used)
- Passing function as Arguments ( factorial - ncr , complex code structure )
- Arrays ( containing a list of all types of values )
- Functions on Arrays   ( diffrent inbuilt method on Arrays - explore  MDN )
- Splice function       ( start index , deletion count, elements to be inserted)
- Iterating over Arrays  ( while , for loop , for ...in , forEach , etc.)
